# VirtualDraping

# Reason: Draping is the key feature for the app.
Unfortunately  there is not an available open source SDK for the draping technology. 
Completing a POC as the first phase of the project will allow the team to determine the viability of a custom solution.

# POC Scope: Create a minimal standalone iPad app to demonstrate “re-coloring” a customer’s cape/gown in a live video feed from the front facing iPad camera. 
The objective of the ‘re-coloring’ will be to demonstrate to the customer the effect that various colors have on the customer’s skin tone. 
The user will be able to select the color from a list of five colors. 

# Considerations:
Lighting – stores will have different temperatures of lighting, the POC will need to account for changes in temperature. A UI control to adjust lighting could be used to make adjustments.
Physical cape – to aid in identifying the physical drape, a physical marker may be proposed to aid the application in identifying the cape
A new color of the cape can be proposed. Currently black and white capes are used.

# Challenges & Risks:
Final color reflection on users skin. This is an unknown area and values will need to be generated. This has also not been done on a video stream, white papers exist for static images only. 
Other unknowns could exist and will be uncovered during the POC.
